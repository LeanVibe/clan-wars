# Project Brief – Ninja Clan Wars

## Vision
Deliver a competitive ninja-themed digital card game optimised for mobile PWA and desktop play. The prototype must showcase tournament-ready mechanics (chakra overflow, terrain rotation, jutsu combos) while supporting rapid iteration via AI coding agents.

## Target Audience
- Competitive gamers aged 16–35 with anime/manga affinity
- Primary platform: mobile-first PWA with desktop parity
- Secondary stakeholders: tournament organisers, shoutcasters, sponsors

## Business Goals
1. Ship a beta-quality prototype suitable for closed competitive tests.
2. Validate the e-sports loop (5-minute matches, terrain rotation, chakra mastery).
3. Enable fast iteration through agent-friendly documentation and modular architecture.

## Success Metrics (Beta)
- ≥70% day-7 retention during closed beta
- ≥30% of active players entering competitive queues
- ≥3 distinct deck archetypes represented in top-tier playtests
- Clear spectator comprehension in usability tests (≥70% baseline understanding)

## Core Game Pillars
- Chakra Management with overflow risk/reward
- Dynamic Terrain Rotation (Mountain, Forest, River lanes)
- High APM Jutsu Combo execution windows (3s)
- Stronghold victory condition (destroy 2 of 3 lanes)

## Scope (Current Milestone)
- Establish Lit + Three.js PWA shell with shared JavaScript core modules
- Visualise battlefield lanes, chakra flow, and deck preview
- Document agent workflows and architectural decisions for continuity
